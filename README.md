# Content Publishing

## Intro

- A new playground for anyone to create, discover, share, reward and distribute articles.
- All articles here are under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
- We help turn articles into NFTs. People can buy their loved NFTs for donation purpose.
- Also, we are building a Creator-DAO to assist creators, which we think is the best solution for people to exchange ideas&information more simply and fairly.
- We aim to help create next-generation content communities with pure open-source, open-data, open-protocols and web3 technology.

## NFT process

- step1: Publish articles at IPFS/Filecoin
- step2: mint only needs to pay a gas fee of less than 1 cent, but the work is not sent to the NFT market
- step3: Send NFT to the market, which can be viewed publicly in the market, and you need to pay a gas fee of less than 1 cent
- step4: Buyer buys it, just as a donation

## Radical Market 3rd Power Curatorial Experiment

### Role

- 1 Human: Ideally, high-quality knowledge should be freely disseminated publicly
- 2 Authors: Authors need at least one of A for survival, B for high-quality communication, and C for readers
- 3 readers: A readers are faced with many works, their attention is limited, and it is difficult to efficiently distinguish whether the quality of the works meets their needs; B readers' attention is valuable but rarely paid
- 4 Markets: A If an NFT work can be traded multiple times, it is easy for people to fall into hype instead of paying attention to the work itself; B Some readers have the strength to support the author, and can reduce the threshold of support as much as possible

### analyze

- In order to allow the above 4 to coexist better, provide a market, the works are shared under the CC-BY-SA license agreement (satisfy 1), and make NFT, the role of purchasing NFT is to support the author (satisfy 2A) and help promote high-quality The dissemination of works (voting with the power of 2) (satisfying 2C); readers refer to the power of 2 voting to select works, and there is an additional dimension of choice (satisfying 3A); a single version of a single work (the author can continue to update) can only be reduced Buy once (meet 4A and 4B)
- Extra 1: The DAO composed of creators, readers, and market providers can obtain a small share of NFT purchases for readers who can keenly discover high-quality works and maintain the normal operation of the market and content community
- Extra 2: The behavior of creation and donation (purchasing NFT) needs to be encouraged, and it also consumes gas. When these two behaviors are completed, ERC20 points can be obtained as proof of creation and proof of donation (the points themselves have no value, just record the value )

### Vulnerability analysis of the game

- Question 1 Buy your own works to earn points. Since a single work uses 2nd power voting (or an improved version), and the current work is uniformly priced by DAO, even if it is swiped 100 times, the score is only 10 times the score of the normal 10 appreciation works, and this is only one of the effects factor
- Question 2 All works can be viewed and curated by third parties for free, no need for such sorting, just donate to the author. Yes, this is an experiment of radical market curation sorting, and there is no guarantee that it will work well
- Question 3 Authors may republish their own works to earn fees. Since the information is publicly available, detection should not be difficult. Authors are encouraged to update and improve their works every mint
- Problem 4 NFTs have poor liquidity. Donations do not require liquidity. out of consideration
- Question 5 **The author wants to choose other license agreements for various reasons, we will gradually support all CC types and other types of license agreements in the future**
